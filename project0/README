==================

*** Notes ***

* This program does not consider "output file already exists" an error. If an output file already exists, it will get overwritten.
* This program uses an array as buffer for _read_ and _write_ calls. May or may not violate what's described in [this thread](https://piazza.com/class/imeeybs22db6n?cid=29)
* This program is based on the man pages for given calls, and example open/creat code in the assignment description.

*** Testing methodology ***

Two simple integration test cases are included in Makefile. 

* First one with input and output files specified, and check if the input and output are different with _diff_;
* Second one checks segfault and catch, and see if the command returns an expected value of 3.

Upon running these tests, an error message will be printed if commands yield unexpected results; Otherwise only test names will be printed.

Other test cases, such as different orders and combination of args, non-existent input file and error opening write file, are tested manually.
