*** Testing methodology ***

For the statistics collection, a shell script is created which runs the program repeatedly with different parameters.

All statistics were collected on seasnet lnxsrv07.

*** Note ***

The correction in 2nd graph is arguable. As the pseudo-randomized result has a (non-negligible) impact on the average time, the trend may not mean much; the general comparison between the two mechanisms could be slightly more meaningful.

Also, since 2B.1A and 2B.2A use different metrics (corrections introduced to 2B.2A), need to remove the "/num_elements" in avg calculation to reproduce the result in 1A.
