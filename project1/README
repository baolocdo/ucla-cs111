Project 1A
==================

*** Notes ***

* This program does not consider "output file already exists" as an error. If an output file already exists, it will get overwritten.
* This program does not check for error returns of _read_ or _write_ calls, as the return value or handling method is not specified in the spec for those cases.
* This program uses an array as buffer for _read_ and _write_ calls, which may or may not violate what's described in [this thread](https://piazza.com/class/imeeybs22db6n?cid=29)
* Since only well-formed inputs are tested, we don't handle the cases where an unexpected flag, or unexpected characters appear in the argv.
* The segfault flag takes precedence in this implementation: if input, output as well as segfault are provided, input and output files will be checked (see if input can be open'ed, and if output can be creat'ed), but they won't be read from or written to as segfault's generated before the read and write commands.
* This program is based on the man pages for given calls, and example open/creat code in the assignment description.
* _Make_ command uses -g flag, so that debug symbols are generated for gdb.
* Among the attached screenshots, "gdb_backtrace" shows the backtrace with "bt full" and "bt" commands in the segfault case; and "gdb_breakpoint" sets a breakpoint before the line causing the segmentation fault, runs the program till that breakpoint, and steps from there.

*** Testing methodology ***

Two simple integration test cases are included in Makefile. 

* First one has input and output files specified, and checks if the input and output are different with _diff_;
* Second one checks segfault and catch, and see if the execution of this program returns an expected value of 3.

Upon running these tests, an error message will be printed if commands yield unexpected results; Otherwise we succeed silently, and only test names will be printed.

Other test cases, such as different orders and combination of arguments, non-existent input file and error opening output file, are tested manually.
