Only myself in my group.

Two observations on indirect.csv:

 - Spec didn't clear up details on "indirect.csv: expected output order of triple indirect blocks" (DFS vs BFS). See my piazza question "https://piazza.com/class/imeeybs22db6n?cid=359".

 - Also, I saw in the footnote that indirect/double/triple pointing at block 0 is handled differently, however, in the doc I also see that
"A value of 0 in this array (i_block) effectively terminates it with no further block being defined. All the remaining entries of the array should still be set to 0."
  So this code took the liberty to assume that the reference implementation is not handling data block 0 (pointed to by any indirect/double/triple blocks) correctly, and ignores all indirect pointers to data block 0.

*** Testing methodology ***

CSV output were collected on seasnet lnxsrv07. Passed check with disk-image but can't guarantee any others, especially corrupted FS, or one that does not follow (ext2-rev1-Linux, for example, if it's not intended for "Linux", the upper 16 bits of uid and gid in an inode may be located at a different "OS dependent" location).
