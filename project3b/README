*** Contents ***

* lab3b.py      - the test driver
* Makefile      - to run the Python script
* README        - this file

*** Notes ***

Only myself in my group.

The code is in Python using Python 2. Seasnet lnxsrv09 has Python 2 by default.

Do "python lab3b.py" with the 6 expected csvs in the same folder, or do "make run" to run the test driver.

*** Testing methodology ***

Passed the given csv files, but can't guarantee for others. Tested on lnxsrv09.
